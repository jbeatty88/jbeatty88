- 👋 Hi, I’m Josh Beatty (@jbeatty88), welcome to my GitHub profile!
- 👀 I’m interested in using software to push the bounds of what's possible.  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying these topics:
  - Kotlin
  - Go
  - Docker and Kubernetes
  - All AWS Associate Certificates
  - MERN Stack
  - Agile software development (SCRUM & Kanban)
  - Project/Product Management
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have potential for significant impact in the education or medical fields.
