- 👋 Hi, I’m Josh Beatty (@jbeatty88), welcome to my GitHub profile!
- 👀 I’m interested in using software to optimize, and in many cases automate, important processes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning these topics:
  - Docker
  - ML with Python using sklearn and tensorflow
  - ReactJS
  - Flutter (Dart)
  - Go
  - Agile software development (SCRUM & Kanban)
  - Project Management
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have potential for significant impact in the education or medical fields.
- 📫 You can reach me at joshbeatty@softwaresugar.co
